A template project that uses Webpack and D3. Designed as a starting point for interactive data visualization projects that require JavaScript code to be organized across many files (as ES6 modules).

The starter code here is from [Stylized Scatter Plot with Color Legend](https://bl.ocks.org/curran/ecb09f2605c7fbbadf0eeb75da5f0a6b).

## Development

This project uses NPM and Webpack. To get started, clone the repository and install dependencies like this:

```
cd dataviz-project-template
npm install
```

You'll need to build the JavaScript bundle using WebPack, using this command:

```
npm run build
```

To see the page run, you'll need to serve the site using a local HTTP server.

```
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```

Now the site should be available at localhost:8080.

For automatic refreshing during development, you can start the Webpack Dev Server like this:

```
npm run serve
```
